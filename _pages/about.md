# üå± About Me

I am Zonglin Zuo, a master's student in Information Science at **Cornell University**, specializing in *Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and UX Research*. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the **University of Washington's [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/)** with a B.S. in Informatics, achieving a major GPA of 3.98.

I have research experience at prestigious institutions such as the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology** and **Tsinghua University**. At Tsinghua University‚Äôs Future Lab, I collaborated with [Professor Jeung Jihong](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/jzg/Central_Organization/r/Resercher/Jeung_Jihong.htm), [Dr. Cheng Xue](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/Alumni1/Central_Organization1/Research_Center_for_Aging_User_Experience_and_Ser1/Cheng_Xue.htm), and [Xinran Jiang](https://www.nua.edu.cn/main.htm). At HKUST, I worked with [Assistant Professor Xin Tong](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XIM08ZwAAAAJ&hl=en) on HCI and cultural heritage research. 

My research interests include **Cultural Heritage, Large Language Models(LLMs), and User Experiences**. I have led teams, conducted extensive user research, and developed innovative solutions, resulting in increased engagement and practical applications. My work has been recognized at top-tier conferences, and my passion lies in collaborative, interdisciplinary work aimed at advancing the HCI field..
